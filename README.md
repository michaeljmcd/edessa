# Edessa

Edessa is a parser combinator library for Clojure. Rather than drawing its
inspiration primarily from common libraries in other languages, like Haskell's
Parsec (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec), it was written by reading
the common papers on the subject and trying to build a new implementation from
scratch.
